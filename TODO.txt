General HTTP goodness:
- HTTPS handling
- Content-MD5
- Caching (using urllib2)

Based on Jersey:
- Should move the JSON handling code out to a MessageBodyReader/Writer
  class, or some equivalent.
- Have to implement GzipContentEncodingFilter
- Introduce Auth filter(s)

Tests:
- Need to turn paths.py into real test with assertions
- Need to test header management somehow
- Need to test logging filter
